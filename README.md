# To Run
- Clone repository to home directory.
- Execute the following command:
$ cd ~/robotics; ./run_me.sh
- Gazebo should open. If it does not, run the command again.
- In a new terminal window, execute the following command:
$ ./run_me2.sh
- The project should now run.

#Troubleshooting
Please ensure:
- roscore is running properly
- robotics is placed on the home directory and is named "robotics".

If you continue to experience problems, please open run_me and run_me2 in your preferred text editor and execute the commands in this file in the terminal, one at a time.

##Have a lovely day!
